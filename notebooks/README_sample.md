# bert-base-ar-cased

We are sharing smaller versions of [bert-base-multilingual-cased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased) that handle a custom number of languages.

Unlike [distilbert-base-multilingual-cased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-multilingual-cased), our versions give exactly the same representations produced by the original model which preserves the original accuracy.


For more information please visit our paper: [Load What You Need: Smaller Versions of Multilingual BERT](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.sustainlp-1.16.pdf).

## How to use

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Geotrend/bert-base-ar-cased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("Geotrend/bert-base-ar-cased")

```

To generate other smaller versions of multilingual transformers please visit [our Github repo](https://github.com/Geotrend-research/smaller-transformers).
